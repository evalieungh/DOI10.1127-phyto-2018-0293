Because of differences in data format, the knowledge test data set was split in two: Knowledge_test_types.csv and Knowledge_test_species.csv. 
In both files, the Reference column gives the correct answer. 
Observers were given the questions in random order, meaning those who did not finish the test within the two-hour time limit (NA values) have answered different questions. 
For the species, common names in norwegian were accepted, but are given in latin here for clarity. Partial names (genus but not species) were not accepted unless specifically asked for. 
Small letter 'x' denotes questions where the observer answered blank.
